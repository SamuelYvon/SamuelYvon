### Hello! :wave:

I currently work as a software developer at Garda World. I was previously an
embedded software developer working on the Microchip PIC platform. I am mainly
a systems developer; I do not touch web applications very often.

When I get the choice, I prefer to work on linux with a combination of nvim and task
specific tools, but I'll use whatever tools make the work easier.

I'm interested in a large amount of things. From my time in university, I got
hooked on graph theory, low level programming and compilation of
dynamically-typed languages.

Outside of coding, I'm what some would call a *coffee geek* and I enjoy strategy games.

#### Presentations

You can find some presentations I did (french and english) on my [youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt1puHbNV1PejKHqNd22zVw). One is also linked on the
[ACM website](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486606.3486783)

#### Programming 

These days, I mostly code in Python and C. I would work with any language, assuming I can get the necessary ramp-up.
