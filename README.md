### Hello! :wave:

I am a master's student at University of Montreal. I am interested in a lot of diverse things,
but at the moment I mainly work on projects related to compilation of dynamically typed
languages.

I currently work as an software developer at Garda World. I was previously an
embedded software developer working on the Microchip PIC platform.

I prefer Linux with neovim as a development environment, but I use whatever tools make the work
easier.

Outside of coding, I'm what some would call a *coffee geek* and I enjoy strategy games.

#### Presentations

You can find some presentations I did (french and english) on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt1puHbNV1PejKHqNd22zVw).

#### Programming 

These days, I mostly code in C and Scheme. I would work with any language, assuming I can get the necessary ramp-up.
