### Hello!

I am a master's student at University of Montreal. I am interested in a lot of diverse things,
but at the moment I mainly work on projects related to compilation of dynamically typed
languages. I also work as an embedded software developer, using the Microchip PIC platform.

I typically code on Linux with neovim :)
