### Hello! :wave:

I currently work as a software developer at Garda World, where I do a bunch of
things, mainly related to integrating artificial intelligence to embedded
systems. 

I was previously an embedded software developer working on the Microchip PIC
platform at M3 Solutions.

I am mainly a systems developer; I do not touch web applications very often. GNU/Linux user.

I'm interested in a large amount of things. From my time in university, I got
hooked on graph theory, low level programming and compilation of
dynamically-typed languages.

Outside of coding, I'm what some would call a *coffee geek* and I enjoy strategy games.

#### Presentations

You can find some presentations I did (french and english) on my [youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt1puHbNV1PejKHqNd22zVw). One is also linked on the
[ACM website](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486606.3486783)

#### Programming skillset

These days I mostly code in Python. I'm still using C for personal projects and
I am currently learning Rust like everyone else. As long as I don't do
JavaScript or Typescript, I'm happy. I have also done lots of (old) Java and
Groovy.
